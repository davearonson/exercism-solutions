# Series

Write a program that will take a string of digits and give you all the possible consecutive number series of length `n` in that string.

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

- 012
- 123
- 234

And the following 4-digit series:

- 0123
- 1234

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-ruby.html).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory. For example, if the test suite is called
`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -rminitest/pride hello_world_test.rb

The test files may have the execution bit set so you may also be able to
run it like this:

    ./hello_world_test.rb
